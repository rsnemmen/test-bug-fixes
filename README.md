Contributing to a GitHub project 
============

This tutorial will help with the following situation: when you are proposing changes to someone else's repo for which you do not have write permissions.

TL;DR: how to pull request or fix bugs in someone else's project.

# Tasks

### 1. fork this repo

i.e. create your own copy of this.

<img src="fork.jpg" width="480px" />

### 2. clone locally your fork

### 3. [Configure your fork to point to the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/)

### 4. create a branch for your edits

```
git checkout -b newbranch
```

### 5. open *source.tex* and each person fixes a specific "error" in the "source code"

But wait for me, I will tell you what an "error" means in this context.

### 6. Commit and push the new branch

```
git commit -am "descreva o que mudou"
git push -u origin newbranch
```

### 7. [Create the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/): contribute your bug fix to the code

### 8. Now I will review your pull requests

### [9. sync your fork with the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)

In order to check out how the original project is evolving (or not) with the input of the group.
